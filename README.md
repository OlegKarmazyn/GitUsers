# GitUsers (Test Task):

- Fetch users from the API and display them in a list: https://api.github.com/users
- When a user is tapped, show their repositories: https://api.github.com/users/{login}/repos
- All data should be cached in an SQLite database.
- Implement pagination for the list of users and the list of repositories for a user.
- Initially, display cached data and then fetch data from the API. The app should also work in offline mode.

Please attach a video of a few seconds demonstrating the project along with the completed task.
The design is arbitrary but should be clear and follow Google's recommendations.
The task should be completed using the MVVM architecture, Kotlin, and Android Compose.
